People have needs, and until the lower ones (like acceptance on the team, job safety or job security) are satisfied, 
they won’t even begin to think about the higher ones (fulfilling their potential and making a contribution).

Hey <name>, h u dng tdy?
<response>
let me thk fr ur time <Nick> and i hope we'll have some good time together.

my nm is naveen and i hail frm the beautiful himalayas (extreme north of india) [xxx -u must hv heard of a place called Nainital- xxx] i'm settled in south for some 8 years now.

<name>, i bring along some 16yrs of exp in change & release management, application mgmt and infrastructure mgmt.. also extensively worked for application development DEVops support setups.. 
ya, i'm popularly tagged as a release manager due to experience and the control i have over this domain.. however off late i rather like to be called a service manager 
due to my excessive obsession to the idea of 'service management' and my last 8 years pursuing it in various capacities.
	

im privileged to have worked for some great orgs like Defense research org, MS, IBM, Barclays. i feel good that i worked for some very good projects across industry, domains and technologies.

[i love to mention i have had privilege working under Dr Kalam's DRDO real time command & control team and where are learned some very fundamental tricks of the trade that i use evn tody
its there where i got exposed to config mgmt, quality mgmt, QA/QC process, methods and tools (following DOD and MIL standards practised there)].


at oakton 

	- i wear two hats, i lead a CoE team called SMO (in lines with the standard PMO we have for proj mgmt).
	  and in my delivery manager role i contribute as as a service delivery manager for our key client Barrick Gold (yes, they produce gold and are world's largest).
	
	- also, as a subject matter expert in SCM tools and techniques, i volunteer for training and consultation on SDLC tools planning and implementation guidance.


before Oakton 
	- i have had privilege working for Barclays Enterprise Middleware group for its leadership team. 
	- In this role i was responsible for redefining release mgmt for BEM, release planning, change mgmt adm, DEV infra mgmt, Builds & deployments, vendor mgmt and Cont Impro initiatives. 

	- I reckon we all had a very fruitful association and i thank BTCI that my contributions were equally rewarded in terms star award, regular feedbacks from my managers and peers. 
	- but unfortunately we cud not work long - i had to leave to support my family in my province due to my young brother's untimely death.
	
	- this is when i started working for Oakton during such tough times who supported me in terms of flexibility to work remotely. but now as org not doing really good and scales down.. 



At IBM 
	- i got opportunity to work with some great organizations and huge projects - mostly in banking sector (also telecom, life sciences)
	- i worked for a leading Thai bank (K-Bank) wherein i led a IBM Rational tools enablement program for their Appl mgmt group (end-to-end IBM Rational enablement & support).
	- as a transition mgr for vodafone money project, offshored production support from existing vendor (Sagentia) and carried out release planning and infra mgmt for new release.
	- For MeadJohnson, a crucial life sciences project, delivered a new change management application project using IBM Rational tools.


At MS 
	- led a team of builders and infra specialists to churn out Windows OS Builds, packaged, tested and released across platforms, across geographies, across stk groups.
	  this is here i came to know about the real impact of changes i handle and releases i ship.
