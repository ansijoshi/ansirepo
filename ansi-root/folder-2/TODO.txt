yeh desh sirf arvind kejriwal ka hai kya?
kya 'Hindustaani', 'Indian' sabd sunkar mere dil mein kuch nahi hota.. jabb kisi bade manch par jan-gan -man bajta hai tow mere sareer main jhur-juri nahi daudti?

ek aadmi apna sabb kuch chhodd kar yeh kichhad saaf karne aata hai aur hum uspar hanste hain.. hamein samajhna hoga hum uss par nahi hansh rahey hum khudd par hanss rahe hain.. uske paas khone ke liye kuchh bhi nahi hai aur humm chahen tow sabb kuch paa sakte hain.

ppl don't have any vested interest whether this party wins or that party wins.. they just want their immediate concerns addressed first which we have not even in 65 years.

desh mera, paisa mera par mutthhi bhar log malai uddhaa rahe hai.. mein apne ghar ke bahar khunta bhi nahi gaadh sakta ye log jo chaahe kar sakte hai.. agar galat ke khilaaf ungali uthaa du to saari umar police thane aur court kachhari mein beet jaati hai.. zindagi bhar ki kamai gaddhe mein.. mere parivaar ka jeevan nark.. mein chhata hoon mere loktantrik desh me swaraj ho.

Water buffallows cross a busy joint on my way to office and it creates a healthy traffic jam, for minimum five minutes, as no one likes to let them cross first. For a change, a gentleman today allowed them to cross first and it just took 30 seconds to clear the traffic.
